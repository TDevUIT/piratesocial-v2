## System Design Overview

### High-Level Architecture

1. **Client-Side**:
   - Users interact via a Next.js frontend.
   - Real-time chat and notifications through Socket.IO.

2. **Backend**:
   - **NestJS API**: Handles business logic for posts, user management, and authentication.
   - **Socket.IO**: Manages real-time communication for messages and notifications.
   - **Redis**: 
     - Caches user sessions and frequently accessed feed data specific to each user for faster retrieval.
     - Handles Pub/Sub mechanisms for Socket.IO events like chat updates and notifications.
   - **PostgreSQL**: Stores structured data, such as user profiles, posts, likes, follows, and comments.

3. **Cache**:
   - **Feed Caching**: User-specific feeds are cached in Redis to minimize database load and ensure fast response times.
   - **Session Management**: Active user sessions and frequently accessed data are stored in Redis.

4. **Object Storage**:
   - **AWS S3**: Stores media uploads securely.
   - **CloudFront**: Serves images and files via a global CDN for faster delivery.

5. **Notifications**:
   - **Socket.IO Notifications**: Real-time alerts for active users.
   - **FCM Push Notifications**: Offline notifications for mobile devices.

6. **Real-time Chat**:
   - **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time messaging for:
     - **One-to-One Chat**: Direct messaging between users.
     - **Group Chat**: Communication within groups with one-to-many capabilities.
